## Q&A

###### What counts as a bug?
A bug could be something thats not working properly or looks out of place.
Such as doing an emote command refuses to work, or some kind of small issue.

###### What are the base rules with posting to the issues tab?
- Stick to the topic
- Don't be a jerk.
- Don't spam
- Don't make duplicate issues.
This is subject to change as this is a "for now" list.
If you write about an issue make sure it isn't listed under Current issues or in another thread.

###### What if I forget or don't add a label?
I personally will add the tags. Don't worry.


## Other Scarlett related things
